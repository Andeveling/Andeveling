## 🧐 About me
I'm Andrés Parra, a passionate frontend developer with nearly two years of experience working with cutting-edge technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React JS, Next JS, ES6+, Redux-Toolkit, MUI, and NextUI. My ultimate goal is to bring designs to life and deliver the best possible user experience by staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends and continuously learning.
What motivates me is the constant drive to improve my craft, discover new tools, and work collaboratively with others. I believe that attention to detail is key to producing high-quality work. Currently, I'm collaborating with a construction industry company on a project that's tailored to their specific needs. To achieve this, we're using NextJS as the main framework for the frontend, while Strapi powers the backend.
Apart from my technical expertise, I take great pride in my ability to work efficiently in teams and solve complex problems. I'm always eager to lend a helping hand, mentor others, and continue learning to expand and enhance my skill set.
